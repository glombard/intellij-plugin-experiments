## Intellij plugin experiments

* [plugin1](plugin1/) - a bare bones implementation of an External System Resolver. It shows the minimum classes needed to create a plugin that can import a project from an external model.
* [intellij-salmon](intellij-salmon/) - a bare bones implementation of a custom test runner. My plan was to write a plugin that imports multiple external junit report XML files. Still lots of work left.
